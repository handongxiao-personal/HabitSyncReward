## Implementation Location

All error handling is implemented in:
- **File**: `/src/components/auth/EmailLogin.jsx`
- **Function**: `handleSubmit` (lines 30-97)

## Console Logging

When an error occurs, the following information is logged to the browser console:
1. `console.error('Authentication failed:', error)` - Full error object
2. `console.error('Error code:', error.code)` - Specific error code
3. `console.error('Error message:', error.message)` - Original error message

This helps developers debug issues while showing user-friendly messages to users.

## How to Test

### Test Wrong Password
1. Create an account with email: `test@example.com`
2. Try to login with wrong password
3. Should see: "Incorrect password. Please try again."
